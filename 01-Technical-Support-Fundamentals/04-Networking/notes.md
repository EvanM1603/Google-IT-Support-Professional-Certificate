# **Overview:**

This module covers computer networking. It explores the history of the Internet and explains what the World Wide Web actually is. It also looks at how data travels across networks, key networking devices, addressing systems, and core networking protocols. The module discusses Internet privacy, security issues, and the broader global impact of networking technologies. By the end of this module, you will understand how the Internet works and the limitations it still has today.

# **Learning Objectives:**

- Recognize the positive as well as negative impacts of the Internet such as privacy and security

- Understand the basics of computer networking

- Understand the basics of how data travels across the Internet

# **Key Concepts**

- **ARPANET:** Early research network created by DARPA in the 1960s that led to the modern Internet

- **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):** Law that restricts the collection of personal data from children under 13

- **Clients:** Devices or software that request data or services from servers

- **DARPA:** U.S. research agency responsible for developing foundational networking technologies

- **Domain name:** The readable text used to identify websites

- **Domain Name System (DNS):** Distributed system that translates domain names into numerical IP addresses

- **Ethernet cable:** A wired standard used to physically connect devices to a network

- **Fiber optic cable:** A high-speed cable that uses light to transmit data through thin glass fibers

- **Globalization:** The increase in worldwide communication and interconnectedness enabled by the Internet

- **Hubs:** Basic devices that repeat data to all connected ports

- **Internet:** A global network of interconnected systems that communicate using shared protocols

- **Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN):** Organisation responsible for domain name management and assignment

- **Internet of Things (IoT):** Network of everyday devices connected to the Internet for automation and data exchange

- **IPv4:** Internet addressing standard using 32-bit numerical addresses

- **IPv6:** Newer addressing standard using 128-bit addresses to expand available address space

- **Internet service provider (ISP):** A company that provides Internet connectivity to customers

- **IP address:** A numerical identifier assigned to a device on a network

- **MAC address:** A unique hardware address assigned to network interface devices

- **Network:** A group of connected devices that share and exchange data

- **Network Address Translation (NAT):** A method that lets multiple private devices share a single public IP address

- **Networking:** The design, management, and operation of computer networks

- **Networking protocols:** Rules that define how data is formatted and transmitted across networks

- **Network stack:** A layered structure (such as TCP/IP) that handles network communication

- **Router:** A device that directs data packets between different networks

- **Server logs:** Files that record events, requests, or errors on a server

- **Servers:** Systems that store and provide data or services to clients

- **Switches:** Devices that forward data intelligently to specific destinations within a network

- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** A major protocol responsible for reliable delivery of network data

- **Uniform Resource Locator (URL):** A web address that identifies the location of an online resource

- **WannaCry Attack:** A large-scale ransomware incident that spread across many networks worldwide

- **Wireless networking (Wi-Fi):** Networking that uses radio waves to communicate without physical cables

- **World Wide Web (WWW):** A system of linked documents and resources accessed through web browsers

# **Notes:**

- The Internet and the Web are not the same; the Internet is the global network, while the Web is a service that runs on it

- Data is broken into packets and routed across multiple networks before reaching its destination

- DNS acts like a directory that converts website names into IP addresses

- Routers and switches play key roles in forwarding and directing packets

- IPv6 exists to solve the shortage of available IPv4 addresses

- Wired connections (Ethernet, fiber) and wireless (Wi-Fi) are the primary ways devices connect to networks

# **Practice Exercises:**

- Describe the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web

- Identify common networking devices and explain their roles

- Explain how DNS converts a website name into an IP address

- Trace the journey of a data packet from a client to a server

# **COMPTIA A+ Exam Notes:**

- Know the function of routers, switches, hubs, and their differences

- Understand IPv4 and IPv6 address structures

- Be familiar with common networking cables, wireless technologies, and basic troubleshooting steps

- Understand the role of DNS, IP addressing, and NAT in everyday networking

- Logging on servers helps track reques
