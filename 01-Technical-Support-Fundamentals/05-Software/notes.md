# **Overview:**

This module covers computer software. It explores what software is, the different types of software IT Support Specialists encounter, and how to manage software effectively. The module also revisits the concept of abstraction and how programs break down into instructions for the CPU. By the end of this module, you will use the Qwiklabs environment to install, update, and remove software on both Windows and Linux operating systems.

# **Learning Objectives:**

- Be able to install software on Windows and Linux

- Understand the main components of software and how they work

- Describe how computers use instructions to process input and produce output

- Describe how a program breaks down into instructions for the CPU

# **Key Concepts:**

- **Application software:** Any software created to fulfill a specific need, like a text editor, web browser, or graphics editor

- **Assembly language:** A low-level human-readable programming language that is converted into machine code for execution

- **Automation:** The use of software or scripts to make processes run automatically without manual intervention

- **Coding:** The act of translating human-readable instructions into a programming language

- **Compiled programming language:** A programming language whose code is translated into machine code ahead of execution using a compiler

- **Copyright:** Legal protection granted to creators for original works

- **.exe:** A file extension for executable files commonly used in Windows

- **Firmware:** Software that is permanently stored on a hardware component

- **GIT:** A version control system that tracks changes in files and directories

- **Interpreted programming language:** A language that is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime rather than compiled ahead of time

- **Programming:** Writing instructions for a computer using a programming language

- **Programming language:** Special languages designed to write instructions that computers can execute

- **Script:** A file run by an interpreter, translating instructions into CPU operations just in time to execute them

- **Scripting:** Writing code in a scripting language

# **Notes:**

- Software is a set of instructions that tells hardware how to perform tasks

- Programs break down into CPU instructions that process input and produce output

- Application software solves specific problems, while system software supports the computer itself

- Programming languages allow developers to write human-readable instructions that are executed by the computer

- Software can be installed, updated, and removed on operating systems like Windows and Linux

- Version control tools like GIT are essential for tracking and managing changes in software development

# **Practice Exercises:**

- Install, update, and remove a software program on Windows using Qwiklabs

- Install, update, and remove a software program on Linux using Qwiklabs

- Identify the difference between application software and system software

- Write a simple script in a scripting language and run it using an interpreter

# **COMPTIA A+ Exam Notes:**

- Know the difference between compiled and interpreted programming languages

- Understand the role of firmware versus application software

- Be familiar with common file extensions like .exe

- Know the basics of version control systems like GIT and how they track changes
