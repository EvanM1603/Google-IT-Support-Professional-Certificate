# **Module 1: Introduction to IT**

## **Overview:**

This module covers an intro to how computers developed, how they represent data, and the basics of IT roles. It covers binary, character encoding, computer architecture, and core IT terminology

## **Learning Objectives:**

- Understand the evolution of computing

- Know how binary and decimal systems work

- Understand basic computer architecture (input, process, storage, output)

- Recognize how data is encoded (ASCII, UTF-8)

- Understand what IT Support Specialists do

## **Key Concepts**

- **Abstraction:** Simplifying complex systems

- **Algorithm:** Steps to solve a problem

- **ASCII:** Early text encoding standard

- **Binary system:** Base-2 number system

- **Byte:** 8 bits

- **Character encoding:** Mapping characters to binary

- **Computer:** Device that stores and processes data

- **Cryptography:** Protecting information using code

- **Decimal system:** Base-10 system

- **Digital divide:** Gap in digital skills and access

- **Information technology:** Using computers to process information

- **Linux OS:** Open-source operating system

- **Logic gates:** Basic building blocks of digital circuits

- **Open source:** Software that can be modified and shared freely

- **PDA:** Early handheld computing device

- **Punch cards:** Old data input method

- **RGB model:** Color model using red, green, blue

- **UTF-8:** Modern character encoding standard

## **Notes:**

- Computing evolved from mechanical tools (abacus, punch cards) to electronic systems we use today

- All digital systems use binary to represent data

- Character encoding standards define how text is stored and transmitted

- Computer architecture generally follows the input → process → output model, with memory and storage supporting the workflow

- Logic gates combine electrical signals to perform basic decision-making operations

- IT Support roles focus on troubleshooting, hardware/software issues, and user assistance

## **Practice Exercises:**

- Convert a few numbers between binary and decimal

- Identify components of a basic computer architecture diagram

- Match character encoding types with examples (ASCII vs UTF-8)

## **COMPTIA A+ Exam Notes:**

- Be comfortable with binary conversions

- Know basic architecture terminology

- Understand high-level differences between ASCII and UTF-8

- Know typical IT Support tasks and responsibilities
