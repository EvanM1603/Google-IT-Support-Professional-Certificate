# **Overview:**

This module introduces how operating systems function, what their main components are, and how they connect with computer hardware. It explains different modern operating systems, how a computer starts up, and the process of installing an OS. The module also covers basic interactions with Windows and Linux, including working with files and using common system tools.

- **Mac OS:** Apple’s desktop operating system for Mac computers

- **Memory management:** The OS’s process of allocating and organizing memory for running programs

- **Metadata:** Information about a file such as its creator, modification time, permissions, and more

- **Microsoft Terminal Services Client:** Software used to connect to remote Windows systems using RDP

- **OpenSSH:** A widely used toolset for establishing secure remote connections on Linux

- **Operating system:** The complete layer of software that manages hardware resources and provides an interface for users

- **PC:** A personal computer intended for individual use

- **Plink (PuTTY Link):** A command-line tool used to create SSH connections after installing PuTTY

- **Powershell:** A command-line shell and scripting environment for Windows

- **Power user:** Someone who has above-average computer skills and uses advanced tools

- **Process management:** How the OS runs programs, assigns resources, and schedules CPU time

- **Qwiklabs:** A platform that offers guided labs for learning cloud technologies

- **Remote connection:** Accessing another computer or network from a distance to manage or interact with it

- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):** Microsoft’s protocol for controlling another device’s desktop from afar

- **Scalability:** A system’s ability to adjust resources as needs grow or shrink

- **Shell:** A program that interprets commands and sends them to the OS

- **SSH (Secure Shell):** A secure method for remotely accessing another computer

- **SSH authentication key:** A secure key pair used instead of passwords when connecting via SSH

- **SSH client:** The program used to initiate an SSH connection

- **SSH server:** Software that allows a device to receive SSH connections

- **Standardization:** Creating consistent rules or formats so different systems work together effectively

- **Swap space:** Disk space used as backup memory when physical RAM is full

- **System:** A combination of hardware and software working together to run applications

- **System settings:** Controls for system behavior such as display, users, network, and devices

- **Task bar:** A tool that shows system status, open programs, notifications, and quick actions

- **Terminal:** A text-based window used to run commands on the system

- **Time slice:** A brief period of CPU time assigned to a running process

- **Ubuntu:** A widely used Linux distribution popular for beginners and general use

- **User name:** A unique identifier that belongs to a user account on the system

- **User space:** The part of the OS where user-facing programs run

- **Virtual Box:** Software used to run virtual machines on a host computer

- **Virtual machine (VM):** A software-based computer that uses physical hardware resources to run its own OS

- **Virtual memory:** Memory created by combining RAM with storage to support more processes

- **VPN (Virtual private network):** A secure way to connect to a network over the internet

# **Notes:**

- Operating systems act as the middle layer between the hardware and the user, coordinating how resources are used

- The kernel handles tasks like memory allocation, process scheduling, and communication with hardware

- User space contains applications, settings, and tools that users interact with directly

- The boot process involves firmware checks, loading the bootloader, and launching the operating system

- Different operating systems provide similar core functions but differ in tools, interfaces, and file management systems

- File systems determine how files are stored, accessed, and organized on a drive

- Remote access technologies such as SSH and RDP allow administrators to manage systems from anywhere

- Virtual machines make it possible to run multiple operating systems safely using shared hardware resources

# **Practice Exercises:**

- Identify the core components of an operating system and describe what each one does

- Outline each stage of the boot process from powering on to loading the user interface

- Install a Linux distribution using a virtual machine

- Create, move, and delete files using both Windows and Linux command-line tools
