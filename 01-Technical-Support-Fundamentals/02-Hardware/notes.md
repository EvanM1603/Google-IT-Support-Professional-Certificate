# **Overview:**

This module covers the main hardware components inside a computer. It explains what each part does and how they work together. It also looks at how the CPU processes instructions and how data moves in binary throughout the system.

# **Learning Objectives:**

- Identify the main hardware components of a computer and their functions

- Understand how the CPU executes instructions and interacts with other parts

- Describe how binary data travels between components

# **Key Concepts:**

- **Address bus:** Connects the CPU to the memory controller and sends the location of the data, not the data itself

- **ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment):** Common interface for connecting hard drives to a system

- **ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended):** Standard motherboard form factor

- **Backward compatible:** Older hardware that works with newer systems

- **BIOS (Basic Input Output System):** Software that initializes hardware and starts the operating system

- **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device):** Using personal devices for work purposes

- **Cache:** Temporary storage for recently or frequently accessed data

- **Charge cycle:** One full battery charge and discharge

- **Chipset:** Controls how components communicate on a motherboard

- **Clock cycle:** One pulse of the CPU’s clock

- **Clock speed:** Number of clock cycles a CPU can perform in a set time

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The processor that executes instructions

- **CPU socket:** The slot or pins that connect a CPU to the motherboard

- **Data sizes:** Units for measuring data, including bit, byte, kilobyte, and megabyte

- **DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM):** Faster and more efficient RAM than older types

- **DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module):** Standard form of RAM module

- **DRAM (Dynamic RAM):** Memory that needs constant refreshing to maintain data

- **Drivers:** Software that allows the CPU to communicate with external devices

- **Electrostatic discharge (ESD):** Sudden flow of electricity that can damage components

- **External Data Bus (EDB):** Pathway that transfers data between CPU and other parts

- **Form factor:** The size and layout standard for motherboards and cases

- **Hard drive (HDD/SSD):** Long-term storage device for data

- **Heatsink:** Component that removes heat from the CPU

- **Instruction set:** The list of operations a CPU can perform

- **LGA (Land Grid Array):** CPU socket type with pins on the motherboard

- **Memory Controller Chip (MCC):** Bridges the CPU and RAM

- **Motherboard:** Main board connecting all hardware components

- **Northbridge:** Chip that connects high-speed components like RAM and GPU

- **NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express):** High-speed storage interface for SSDs

- **PCI Express (PCIe):** High-speed interface for expansion cards

- **Peripherals:** External devices connected to a computer (mouse, keyboard, monitor)

- **POST (Power-On Self Test):** Hardware check that runs when a computer starts

- **Power supply:** Converts electricity from the wall to usable power for the computer

- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Temporary memory for active processes

- **Registers:** Small, fast storage locations in the CPU

- **ROM (Read-Only Memory):** Memory storing permanent instructions like BIOS

- **SATA (Serial ATA):** Standard interface for connecting storage devices

- **SOC (System on a Chip):** Integrates CPU, RAM, and sometimes storage on one chip

- **Southbridge:** Chip that handles input/output controllers like USB and storage

- **SSD (Solid State Drive):** Fast storage device with no moving parts

- **Standoffs:** Raise the motherboard above the case to prevent shorts

- **Thermal paste:** Improves heat transfer between CPU and heatsink

- **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface):** Modern replacement for BIOS

- **USB (Universal Serial Bus):** Standard for connecting peripherals

- **Type-C connector:** USB connector that supports power, data, and video transfer

# **Notes:**

- Computers are built from hardware components that each have specific roles  

- The CPU executes instructions stored in memory and interacts with other components via the motherboard

- RAM temporarily holds active data for quick access, while storage keeps data long-term

- Input and output devices allow interaction between the user and the computer

- The GPU is specialized for processing graphics but can also perform parallel computations  

- Data travels in binary along pathways called buses to reach the CPU, memory, or peripherals

- Proper power supply and cooling are essential for stable operation

# **Practice Exercises:**

- Identify the main hardware components inside a computer

- Describe the role of each component in the computer’s workflow

- Trace how binary data moves from input → CPU → output
