# **Overview:**

In the second module of this course, we'll learn about what's inside a computer. We'll explore the main hardware components, what each component does, and how they work together to make a computer function. By the end of this module, you will also understand how the CPU processes instructions and how binary data moves through a computer.  

# **Learning Objectives:**
- Describe the main components that make up a computer and how they interact.  
- Understand how the CPU takes instructions and executes them.  
- Describe how binary data physically travels throughout a computer.  

# **Key Concepts:**
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The brain of the computer that executes instructions.  
- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Temporary memory that stores data for active processes.  
- **Storage:** Permanent data storage devices (HDDs, SSDs).  
- **Motherboard:** Main circuit board connecting all components.  
- **Power Supply Unit (PSU):** Provides power to all components.  
- **Input devices:** Tools for sending data to the computer (keyboard, mouse).  
- **Output devices:** Tools for receiving data from the computer (monitor, printer).  
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** Handles rendering of images and videos.  
- **Bus:** Pathway that transfers data between components.  
- **Binary Data:** The 1s and 0s that computers use to represent information.  
- **Peripheral devices:** External devices connected to the computer (USB drives, printers).  
- **Cooling systems:** Maintain safe operating temperatures for components.  

# **Notes:**
- Computers are built from **hardware components** that each have specific roles.  
- The **CPU** executes instructions stored in memory and interacts with other components via the **motherboard**.  
- **RAM** temporarily holds active data for quick access, while **storage** keeps data long-term.  
- **Input and output devices** allow interaction between the user and the computer.  
- The **GPU** is specialized for processing graphics but can also perform parallel computations.  
- **Data travels in binary** along pathways called buses to reach the CPU, memory, or peripherals.  
- Proper **power supply** and **cooling** are essential for stable operation.  

# **Practise Exercises:**
- Identify the main hardware components inside a computer.  
- Describe the role of each component in the computer’s workflow.  
- Trace how binary data moves from input → CPU → output.  

# **COMPTIA A+ Exam Notes:**
- Know the main hardware components and their functions.  
- Understand the difference between **RAM** and **storage**.  
- Know the function of **CPU**, **GPU**, **motherboard**, **PSU**, and **cooling systems**.  
- Be able to describe how binary data moves through a computer.  
- Be familiar with common **input/output devices** and **peripherals**.
